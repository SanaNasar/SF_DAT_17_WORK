# My Data Science Course Project

## Project Deliverables

You are responsible for creating a **project paper** and a **project presentation**. The paper should be written with a technical audience in mind, while the presentation should target a more general audience. You will deliver your presentation (including slides) during the final week of class, though you are also encouraged to present it to other audiences.

Here are the components you should aim to cover in your **paper**:

* Problem statement and hypothesis
* Description of your data set and how it was obtained
* Description of any pre-processing steps you took
* What you learned from exploring the data, including visualizations
* How you chose which features to use in your analysis
* Details of your modeling process, including how you selected your models and validated them
* Your challenges and successes
* Possible extensions or business applications of your project
* Conclusions and key learnings

Your **presentation** should cover these components with less breadth and less depth. Focus on creating an engaging, clear, and informative presentation that tells the story of your project.

You should create a GitHub repository for your project that contains the following:

* **Project paper:** any format (PDF, Markdown, etc.)
* **Presentation slides:** any format (PDF, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.)
* **Code:** commented Python scripts, and any other code you used in the project
* **Data:** data files in "raw" or "processed" format
* **Data dictionary (aka "code book"):** description of each variable, including units

If it's not possible or practical to include your entire dataset, you should link to your data source and provide a sample of the data. (GitHub has a [size limit](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/) of 100 MB per file and 1 GB per repository.) If your data is private, you can either include an "anonymized" version of your data or create a private GitHub repository.


## Milestones

## What is the Question I hope to answer?



### October 26 (Mandatory): First Draft Due

Zip up all files relevant to your project, and email them to Sinan. Your peers and instructors will provide feedback, according to [these guidelines](peer_review.md).

At a minimum, you should include:
* Narrative of what you have done so far and what you are still planning to do, ideally in a format similar to the format of your final project paper
* Code, with lots of comments

Ideally, you would also include:
* Visualizations you have done
* Slides (if you have started making them)
* Data and data dictionary

Tips for success:
* The work should stand "on its own", and should not depend upon the reader remembering anything you might have previously said in class about your project.
* Organize your narrative and files so that the reader can easily follow along.
* The better you explain your project, and the easier it is to follow, the more useful feedback you will receive!
* If your reviewers can actually run your code on the provided data, they will be able to give you more useful feedback on your code. (It can be very hard to make useful code suggestions on code that can't be run!)


### November 18 (Optional): Second Draft Due 

If you would like additional feedback on your project, submit a revised version of your project. Your instructors will provide feedback. (There is no peer review for the second draft.)


### November 31 and December 2: Presentation

Deliver your project presentation in class, and submit all required deliverables (paper, slides, code, data, and data dictionary).
